    "- Binning the Lightning Data\n",
    "- Joining the Datasets\n",

    "\n",
    "This notebook should be executed after the `data_file_cleaning.ipynb` notebook. \n",
    "\n",
    "In the Combining Files section, we use the Google Drive API to grab and combine all the separate files in the folder where our data lives. We also parse the tropical cyclone (TC) ID and name from each of the file names to add as columns. This section will create intermediate files in a directory called `processed_files`, and `Combined_Reduced_Trackfile.txt` and `Combined_WWLLN_Locations.txt` in a directory called `combined_files` for use in the next section. The `processed_files` directory and its contents can be deleted after completion of this section.\n",
    "\n",
    "In the Cleaning and Filtering section, we perform some post-processing on the data by adding column headers, filtering to tropical cyclones that are category 1 or higher, and calculating the direct distance of each lightning strike to the TC storm center. This will create additional `Filtered_Reduced_Trackfile.csv` and `Filtered_WWLLN_Locations.txt` files. \n",

    "The Binning the Lightning Data section creates 30 minute bins for use in evaluating lightning burst thresholds and comparison with TC wind and pressure data.

    "The last part of this notebook, Calculating Current Category and Intensification Change, calculates category and intensification change bins for use in the burst threshold analysis.

    "We use the [Google Drive API](https://developers.google.com/drive/api/guides/about-sdk) to download the files previously uploaded in `data_upload.ipynb` to consolidate the individual files. The first half of the code works if the Google Drive API is already set up (refer to instructions in `data_upload.ipynb`). The code after we create the list of files is not dependent on the Google Drive API. This section will create intermediate files in a directory called `processed_files`, and `Combined_Reduced_Trackfile.txt` and `Combined_WWLLN_Locations.txt` in a directory called `combined_files` for use in the next section.

    "The trackfile data includes wind and pressure data at regular intervals for each TC. Since there is no function that approximates the behavior of TC wind and pressure change, we will not interpolate the data for timestamps between the intervals - rather, we will join each lightning event to the nearest wind and pressure data and perform our analysis as such. We recognize that this process is a source of error, but we believe that joining to the nearest timestamp will keep this known error as low as possible for the sake of this analysis.\n",

    "### Calculating Current Category and Intensification Change\n",
    "After joining the WWLLN lightning events to its nearest wind and pressure data, we will then calculate the intensity change and category at the time of each lightning event. Intensity change is defined as the difference between the current wind speed and the wind speed 24 hours later. If the exact 24 hour timestamp cannot be found, we will compare with the closest timestamp to 24 hours. The current category of the TC at the time of the lightning event is evaluated based on the current wind speed. Once again, we refer to the [Saffir-Simpson Hurricane Wind Scale](https://www.nhc.noaa.gov/aboutsshws.php).\n",
