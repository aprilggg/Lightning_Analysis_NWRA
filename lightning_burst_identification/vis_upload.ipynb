    "This notebook uploads the visualizations in the `visualizations/` folder created in `lightning_threshold_innercore.ipynb` and `lightning_threshold_rainband.ipynb` to Google Drive. This notebook should be run after the creation of the visualizations in the previously mentioned notebooks. We use the [Google Drive API](https://developers.google.com/drive/api/guides/about-sdk) to facilitate interactions with Google Drive and use multithreading to speed up the uploading process.\n",

    "1. Start by creating a Google Cloud project. We use the free tier. [Official Documentation](https://console.cloud.google.com/projectcreate?sjid=1200308559223672915-NC&inv=1&invt=AbjYiw)\n",
    "2. Enable the Google Drive API. Navigate to the APIs & Services page, click the \"Enable APIs and Services\" button, and search for \"Google Drive API\". Click \"Enable\" if not already enabled.\n",
    "3. Configure the OAuth consent screen as needed by navigating to APIs & Services > OAuth consent screen. For the sake of this project, we leave the app in testing mode and manually add test users for access. Users can be added in the \"Test users\" section.

    "4. Create credentials. Navigate to APIs & Services > Credentials. Click \"Create Credentials\" and select \"OAuth 2.0 Client ID\". Select \"Desktop app\" as the application type and download the json file. Rename the file to `client_secret.json` and move this to the same directory as this script.
